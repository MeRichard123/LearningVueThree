# composition-api

A Feature in Vue 3 which gives up another way to write the script block

## Why?

1. Larger vue project were hard to manage as they grew in size,
   components were organised in options so logic isn't grouped by feature SOC.

2. Reusing logic across components became difficult even with mixins.
